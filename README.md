# Packages ðŸ“¦

## Primitives ðŸ—¿
The primitives library is a component library for Nextjs created by the Inspr team!

To use our primitives library, run the following npm command:

```bash
npm i @primal/icons @primal/state @primal/theme @primal/primitives
```

The @primal/icons is responsible for having all the icons .svg related to the project, @primal/state manage the state and the state dependencies of all the components, @primal/theme has all the themes that is already linked to the project or manage the custom themes that can me added and @primal/primitives has all the components that where created.

This package has as peerDepencies the following:
```json
"@emotion/react": "^11.7.1",
"@emotion/styled": "^11.6.0",
"next": "^12.0.8",
"react": "^17.0.2",
"react-dom": "^17.0.2"
```

Since npm does not install them automatically, you can do:
```bash
npm i @emotion/react@11.1.4 @emotion/styled@11.6.0 react react-dom next
```

Or, if you start your Next application with:

```bash
npx create-next-app website --ts
```

Then you can only install emotion after that!

Finally, when you create your Next application you need to tell Next to transpile some of our libraries, since they were done in Typescript! To do that you can install the [Next Transpile Modules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-transpile-modules). To that, run the command:

```bash
npm i next-transpile-modules
```

And in your next.config.js add:
```js
const withTM = require("next-transpile-modules")([
    "@primal/state",
    "@primal/theme",
    "@primal/primitives",
])

module.exports = withTM({})
```

After that your project should be able to use our amazing primitives building blocks (hoooray âœ¨).

### Components 

#### Author Component

If your web page renders awesome articles written by real people, you can definetly use the Author Component to give them a way to showcase themselves!

The code for it is as follows:
```jsx
import { Spacer, Author } from "@inspr/primitives"
import polenta from "../public/polenta.png"

<Author
    size="sm"
    name={{ firstName: "Polenta", lastName: "B." }}
    image={{ src: polenta, alt: "Example Image :)" }}
    userId="polentinha"
    onClick={() => {
        console.log("How awesome!")
    }}
/>
```

#### Avatar Component

The Avatar component is simply for those ones who hate having an amazing image but don't know how to make it turn into a ball-shaped avatar like image. 

The code for it is as follows:
```jsx
import { Avatar } from "@inspr/primitives"
import polenta from "../public/polenta.png"

<Avatar
    src={polenta}
    alt={"Our good doggie, but bigger now."}
    size="xl"
/>
```

#### Breadcrumb Component
Our Breadcrumb component is surprising for its simplicity. The idea of a breadcrumb is to help you navigate back to where you were inside your web app. If you have a page that stays nested inside a very complex routing system, this component might help you out. 

The code for it is as follows:
```jsx
import { Breadcrumbs } from "@inspr/primitives"

<Breadcrumbs url={"/blog/microservices-benefits"} />
<Breadcrumbs home="blog" url={"/blog/microservices-benefits"} />
<Breadcrumbs url={"/blog/super/crazy/long/nested/page/example"} />
<Breadcrumbs
    home="nested"
    url={"/blog/super/crazy/long/nested/page/example"}
/>
```

#### Button Component
I've never seen a website with a button... Said no one ever! We've got you covered on the buttons department, to use our buttons you must have our Theme library installed, this was a decision made to make your life simpler, once our Theme library comes with the powers of variants which will be shown in the code below!

The code for it is as follows:
```jsx
import { Button } from "@inspr/primitives"
    
<Button
    label="Go to INSPR"
    variant="primary"
    iconKind="line"
    iconRight="arrowRight"
    onClick={() => window.location.assign("https://inspr.com")}
/>
```

#### Card Component
Our card component is another one distinguished by it's simplicity. If you want text organized in a card manner, this is it. 

The code for it is as follows:
```jsx
import { Card, Text, Spacer } from "@inspr/primitives"

const newStyle = css`
    border: 5px solid green;
`
<Card shadow="md" width="fit-content" height="fit-content">
    <Text
        size="lg"
        color="umbra"
        weight="bold"
        lineHeight="lg"
        family="opensauce">
        Easy to configure
    </Text>
    <Spacer size="sm" />
    <Text size="md" lineHeight="md">
        Design, connect, and deploy your applications quickly.
    </Text>
</Card>
```

#### Checkbox Component
Our checkbox component is a bit different. For itself it only the little box, onClick it does not mark, (but of course we are going to show you a way to do that). Also it can be used in two ways: alone and in group. 

The code for it is as follows:
```jsx
import { Checkbox } from "@inspr/primitives"

<Checkbox
    variant="error"
    size="lg"
    isActive={true}
    disabled={false}
    onChange={someFunction}>
    Item 1
</Checkbox>
```

#### Grid Component
The grid component organize the pages with a template that has a value for colums and rows, this values define how many sections of the grid will be used by each component, the grid can adjuste acording to the page size(xs, sm, md, lg).

The code for it is as follows:
```jsx
import { Grid, View, Image } from "@inspr/primitives"

<Grid maxColumns={{ repeat: 8, unit: "1fr" }}>
    <Grid.Item
        xs={{
            row: [1, 2],
            column: [1, 9],
        }}
        justify="center">
        {cover && (
            <View
                layout={{
                    width: "100%",
                    height: "550px",
                }}>
                <Image
                    src={cover.url}
                    alt={cover.alternativeText}
                    height={550}
                    width={10000}
                    objectFit="cover"
                />
            </View>
        )}
    </Grid.Item>
    <Grid.Item
        xs={{
            row: [2, 3],
            column: [1, 8],
        }}
        sm={{
            row: [2, 4],
            column: [1, 8],
        }}
        direction="column">
            content
    </Grid.Item>
    <Grid.Item
        xs={{
            row: [3, 4],
            column: [1, 8],
        }}
        sm={{
            row: [4, 5],
            column: [1, 8],
        }}
        direction="column">
        <View layout={{ padding: { right: "24px", left: "24px" } }}>
            {
                markdownProcessor.processSync(content)
                    .result as React.ReactChild
            }
        </View>
    </Grid.Item>
</Grid>
```

#### Icon Component
